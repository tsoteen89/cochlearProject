                                    <u>Notice of Privacy Practices</u>. BA agrees that it will abide by the

                                    adverse effect on that party's business operations, then the party may, upon
                                    written notice, require the other party to enter into good faith negotiations
                                    to renegotiate the terms of this BAA and to take any action necessary to

                                    terminate this BAA effective upon notice to the other party.</p>

                                    <u>Arbitration</u>. Any controversy or claim arising out of this BAA,
                                    or the breach thereof, will be settled by arbitration in accordance with the
                                    rules of the American Arbitration Association, and judgment upon the award
                                    rendered by the arbitration may be entered in any court having jurisdiction
                                    thereof.  The arbitration agreement set forth herein will not limit a court
                                    from granting a temporary restraining order or preliminary injunction in order
                                    to preserve the status quo of the parties pending arbitration.  Further, the
                                    arbitrator(s) will have power to enter such orders by way of interim award, and
                                    they will be enforceable in court.  The place of such arbitration will be in
                                    Travis County, Texas.</p>
