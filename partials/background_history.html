Home
Welcome to the Auditory Implant Initiative!  Our organization is dedicated to improving cochlear implant care in the community setting by focusing on research, collaboration and outreach. Our vision is to shift the paradigm of cochlear implant care from being “provider-centric” to being “patient-centric”. We want all patients to have access to high-quality implant care as close to home as possible.  
This site provides HIPAA complaint tools and support for implant providers (surgeons, audiologists, speech/language pathologists) to coordinate care and track outcomes. We hope you will find our resources valuable as you strive to provide the best implant care possible. 

About
While cochlear implant technology has been utilized clinically for several decades, a very small percentage of implant candidates actually are benefiting from this technology. In the United States, only about 50% of children and less than 5% of adults who could benefit from a cochlear implant have actually been implanted (1).  The Auditory Implant Initiative strives to improve access to implant care by connecting and supporting implant providers in the community setting.  
History
The Auditory Implant Initiative was founded in 2013 by a group of surgeons and audiologists who recognized a need for more standardized, organized, patient-centered cochlear implant care in the United States, specifically in the non-urban/community setting.  AII has been organized as a non-profit organization in the State of Texas.
