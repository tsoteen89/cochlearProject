### Example Audiogram via Noah

### Pure Tone Average

PTA = Pure Tone Average

> This is the average dB calculated using the dB's presented at the 500hz, 1Khz, and 2Khz frequencies.

### Bone Conduction

> Bone Conduction is a measurement of hearing using vibrations through the mastoid (portion of the temporal bones). This type of hearing should not be better than Air Conduction. If it is, something is definitely wrong.

### Normal Hearing

- Assume  ___X___ is an individuals hearing.
- Normal = `0dB <= X <= 20dB`

Note:

- `0 dB's` (zero) CAN be heard and there are even instances where an individual can hear `-(dB's)`. 
- This is why the normal scale for measurement = `-10dB <= X <= 120dB`
- I'm assuming that there my be extreme outliers, but extremely rare since the eardrum ruptures `~150dB's`
