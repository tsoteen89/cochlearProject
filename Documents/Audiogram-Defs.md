##Summary of meeting with Kimberly

### Left and Right

- red = right
- blue = left

### Symbols

Measure           | Right Symbol | Abbr | Left Symbol | Measured
:----------------:|:------------:|:----:|:-----------:|:--------:
Air Conduction    | O            |  AC  |      X      |   dB
Bone Conduction<sup>1</sup>   | <            |  BC  |      >      |   dB
Bone Conduction<sup>2</sup>   | [            |  BC  |      ]      |   dB

### Example Audiogram via Noah

### Pure Tone Average

PTA = Pure Tone Average

>This is the average dB calculated using the dB's presented at the 500hz, 1Khz, and 2Khz frequencies.

### Normal Hearing

- Assume  ___X___ is an individuals hearing.
- Normal = `0dB <= X <= 20dB`

Note:

- `0 dB's` (zero) CAN be heard and there are even instances where an individual can hear `-(dB's)`. 
- This is why the normal scale for measurement = `-10dB <= X <= 120dB`
- I'm assuming that there my be extreme outliers, but extremely rare since the eardrum ruptures `~150dB's`
