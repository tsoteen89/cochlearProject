### Cookie Contents (unnecessary struck through)

- The "all encompassing cookie" needs reduced. 
- I hope that many of the pages don't rely too much on this easy access data. 
- We probably need one or more api calls to get the necessary info to either help with subsequent queries, or just return everything as below with a single "everything" api call, but not store it in a cookie.
